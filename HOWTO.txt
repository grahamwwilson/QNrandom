HOWTO.txt

These programs are written with the more recent version of python, 
namely python 3.

Some of the programs have dependencies on numpy, matplotlib and scipy. 
These are available from Notebook type interfaces like Colab 
or Jupyter (with Anaconda installed), or need to be installed 
with your python3 installation.

There are three complementary ways to work with 
increasing functionality, and specific IDEs like Spyder available.

1) Google Colaboratory (or Colab for short).
   Go to the URL, https://colab.research.google.com 
   and execute Python from your browser using cloud resources.
   
   Create a notebook, copy python code such as Uniform.py 
   into a cell, and execute.

2) Install Anaconda (to ensure local access to Jupyter 
   notebook and the scientific libraries). Details depend on OS. 
   See https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/ and the Anaconda Cheat Sheet.

   i) Use Jupyter notebook as a notebook style interface. 
      Again, create a notebook, copy python code into a cell, and execute.
      This executes locally.

  ii) Run python "natively" from the command line on your computer.
      Examples "python3 Uniform.py"
               "python3 Gaussian-NoMyRandom.py"

Option 1, should be minimalist effort and allow you to use this code.
Option 2, likely preferable for further development and exploration.
